Outline of Transcriptomic Core Draft:


Draft will be written in Google Doc - versions will be saved to GitHub


Wed, Aug 13, 2014 - Work on DEGs, Transcriptome Characterization, Methods & Literature
Thurs, Aug 14, 2014 - Divide up DEGs and Transcriptome - each person to tackle different processes
Fri, Aug 15, 2014 - Finalize current results - Work on presentation 


Methods


Sample collection
- Selection process (size, location, color?)
- 3 sites (GPS coordinates)
- Transport from field to laboratory


Experimental set-up
- Husbandry conditions and locations - set-up before the stars came
- Acclimation period? 
- Experimental design - individually housed? number of tanks; dimensions of tanks; 
- Monitoring of conditions during experiment 
Termination 


Sample processing and preservation




Sequencing, assembly, annotation


Transcriptome exploration




Differential expression analyses 
- Enrichment … 
- … 




Results
- Characterization of the transcriptome
- Infection (by DEGs) - numbers
- Enriched (will focus the gene families/genes that are of interest) - function


Discussion
Four Major processes enriched - expanded:
1. immune
2. cytokines
3. biological adhesion
4. nervous/cytoskeletal/connective tissue-related
In addition, allow for a few additional genes of interest


Supplementary
- A single iPython notebook streamlining all analyses 
        - Or minimally,
