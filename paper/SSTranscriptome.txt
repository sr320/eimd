Filtering criteria: 
1) Find your process tab (i.e. immune, biological adhesion or cytokines) which has no duplicates within the process
2) Ensure that, for each contig, all 3 samples in one condition have values for at least one of the conditions (healthy or sick)
3) Sort by log fold change - take most positive AND most negative (minimum of + 10 and -10 if possible) ADD any additional genes of “interest”if they don’t fall within this
4) Assess if p=0.01 is necessary to give you a manageable number to work with 
5) Take SPID and put it into beta.uniprot.org/uniprot/ (+your SPID) and into your OWN spreadsheet (each of us will edit our own for now) - see format linked document: Example File to Input SPID Info
6) Note biological functions the gene is involved with and begin literature back-up, with emphasis on papers linked to that gene in the Swiss Prot database; interpret involvement in the broader biological process (i.e. immune, cell adhesion, or cytokines)
7) Come up with 1 or 2 possibilities of why it would differ between conditions

Abstract: 
* General comment on echinoderms and immune systems
* Transcriptomics of sea urchins show a suite of immune response proteins; sea stars likely to share many
* Transcriptomics as tool to quantify sea star response to infection to sea star wasting disease

Echinoderms lack adaptive immunity [c]but possess a complex innate immune system with specialized phagocytotic cells and signalling molecules that circulate through the body in coelomic fluid (Franco et al. 2011, Smith et al. 2010). In the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, variability within a relatively small number of gene families produces the diversity of proteins involved in the innate immune response and proteins suggested to have pathogen-specific recognition, potential precursors to adaptive immunity (Hibino et al. 2006). Several pathways respond to immune challenge assays, including the complement pathway, TOLL-like receptors (TLRs), and cell adhesion regulation (Hibino et al. 2006, Smith et al. 2010, Dheilly et al. 2013).


Innate Immunity Paragraph
        Echinoderm complement cascades are confirmed to included at least Complement C3 and Bf/C2 like compounds. C3 is known to function in opsonization and increased phagocytosis, which BfC2 increases concentrations of C3 in coelomcytes (Clow et al 2004, Terwilliger et al 2004). The melanin synthesis cascade in invertebrates serves roles in wound healing and immune response by creating chemical/physical barriers and encapsulating pathogens for phagocytosis(Cerenius & Söderhäll 2004).  However, Echinoderms have found to have relatively low abundances of circulating prophenoloxidase, which suggests that melanization may not be a crucial part of their immune functioning (Smith and Soderhall, 1991).


Patterns of gene expression during immune response can be used to help infer the mechanisms echinoderms use in fighting infections. St[d][e]arting in summer 2013, sea star wasting disease caused severe population declines in multiple sea star species along the North American Pacific coast (MARINe 2013).[f][g][h][i][j] The first symptoms of disease include abnormally twisted arms, a deflated appearance, and small white lesions on the aboral body wall. As the disease progresses, tissue degrades and begins to lose structure, leading to arm loss and death (Eckert et al. 2000). The time from appearance of twisting in a population to the onset of more severe symptoms varies markedly between sites (Eisenlord, pers. obs.). Previous outbreaks of the disease have coincided with periods of above-average temperatures, and laboratory challenge experiments also show increased infection rates at higher temperatures (Eckert et al. 2000, Bates et al. 2009). Because sea stars serve as keystone species in maintaining the trophic structure of intertidal and subtidal food webs, loss of Asteroid populations to wasting syndrome outbreaks have the potential to shift community composition of intertidal and subtidal ecosystems (Paine 1974, Duggins 1983).
        Outside of sea urchins, echinoderm immunity has not been well-characterized, especially in the class Asteroidea.[k][l] The 2013 wasting disease outbreak offered the opportunity to examine the gene expression patterns of the sea star immune response in the sunflower star Pycnopodia helianthoides. Through an infection challenge experiment, we were able to induce wasting disease in previously healthy individuals, allowing sequencing and characterization of the sea star transcriptome in healthy and infected stars. Our P. helianthoides transcriptome the first transcriptome to characterize immunity in the class Asteroidea and represents the third transcriptome from the phylum Echinodermata. While we focus on immune response, the P. helianthoides transcriptome sequence will be useful for future studies in the evolution and physiology of invertebrates.








Methods


Experimental Design[m][n][o][p] 
Pycnopodia helianthoides (radius 160.5 +/- 30.9 mm) were collected from three sites in Washington State: Dabob Bay (DB), WA (47.81292395845202, -122.82028198242188); Port Hadlock Marina (PH), WA (48.030385269179185, -122.74497628211975); Friday Harbor (FH), WA (48.545091102002814, -123.01227450370789). Sites had no reports of SSWD[q] infection at time of collection and no animals collected showed clinical signs. An effort was made to collect animals within a similar size range to reduce variation based on body mass but otherwise selection was random. Experiments were conducted at Marrowstone USGS Laboratory, WA. P. helianthoides were transported to the lab on the day of collection in coolers, wrapped in cloth soaked in seawater from the site.
On arrival, animals were examined for signs of disease or trauma and animals were transferred to individual 10 gallon aquariums with separate flow-through sand-filtered and UV-treated seawater kept at ~8.5°C . Acclimation period was 2.5 months to 3 days, depending on time of collection. During this period, animals were examined for signs of disease and fed live manila clams every 3-4 days. Water flow was checked daily.
An infection challenge was conducted with filtered tissue homogenate prepared from of three P. helianthoides with clinical signs of SSWD (tissue used: tube feet, dermal tissue, and coelomic fluid). The tissue was ground with a mortar and pestle then placed in a Stomacher with 10 mL seawater from the aquarium housing one of the symptomatic animals used for tissue. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 x g for 5 min at 4°C then  split into two 5 mL aliquots. One aliquot was boiled for 7 minutes to serve as a control. The non-heated aliquot was syringe-filtered through a 5μm polycarbonate, a 1μm polycarbonate and a 0.22 μm polyethylsulfone filter respectively. One animal from each site was randomly chosen to be a control and a treatment. Animals were treated with either control or 0.22 μm filtered inocula (0.5 mL) by injection into the coelomic cavity, under the dermis on the dorsal side of arm, and within the armpit. The animals were checked twice daily and any physical or behavioral changes recorded. Animals were sacrificed at 9 days post injection once all three treatment animals showed small lesions. Stars were sampled while lesions were small and they still had turgor so the coelomic fluid could be extracted from an intact animal. Coelomic fluid was collected from the arm of the animal using a syringe. The samples were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1200 rpm at 4°C to separate the coelomocytes. The fluid was then removed and the pellet containing the coelomocytes flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples placed at -80 C freezer for RNA extraction. 




        
High Throughput Sequencing and Assembly
Total RNA was extracted using Tri-Reagent per manufacturer’s instruction. Potential DNA carry-over was removed from extracted RNA using the Turbo DNA-free treatment according to the manufacturer's instructions (Ambion). Library preparation was done at the Cornell Microarray facility using the mRNA-Seq 8-Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, California) followed by sequencing preparation using the standard protocols (Illumina, San Diego, California) at the Cornell University. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Hi-Seq where 100bp paired end sequencing was performed. 
Quality trimming of resulting sequencing reads was performed using CLC Genomics Workbench v. 7.0 (CLC Bio, Germany) with the following parameters: quality limit = 0.05, number of ambiguous nucleotides < 2 on ends, reads shorter than 20 bp were removed, and Illumina PCR primers were removed. De novo assembly was performed with Genomics Workbench 7. 5.0 (CLC Bio, Germany) on quality trimmed sequences with the following parameters; automatic bubble size, automatic word size, auto-detect paired distances, perform scaffolding, and minimum contig size of 500 bp.  In order to remove bacterial sequences from the transcriptome data, consensus sequences were compared to the NCBI nt database using the BLASTn algorithm. Consensus sequences with significant matches (evalue = 0) to bacterial sequences were removed and not considered in subsequent analyses. 


Transcriptome Annotation.
Transcriptomic sequences were annotated by comparing contiguous sequences to the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database. Comparisons were made using the BLASTx algorithm with a 1.0E-5 e-value threshold. Genes were classified according to Swiss-Prot Gene Ontology (GO) associations, as well as respective parent categories (GO Slim). In addition the transcriptome was compared to PATRIA?[r][s]






        
Differential Expression Analysis
Differential expression of contigs was calculated using a negative binomial GLM in the R package DESeq2 (Anders and Huber 2010). The read counts were first normalized using the size factors method and fit to a negative binomial distribution. Significantly differential contig expression (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p<0.05 ) between control and exposed animals was determined using the Wald test for significance of GLM terms.


Enrichment Analysis
Enriched GO terms associated with differentially expressed genes were identified using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) v. 6.7 [refs]. The specific GO category (GO FAT), developed as part of the Annotation Tool of the DAVID suite of bioinformatics resources, is a category that filters out broad GO terms based on a measured specificity of each term.[t][u] The UniProt accession numbers for differentially expressed genes were uploaded as a gene list, while all UniProt accession numbers for annotated transcriptomic contigs were used as a background. Significantly enriched GO terms were identified as those with Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p<0.05. Enriched GO terms were clustered in semantic space using Revigo [refs].




















Results[v]


Inoculation Experiment
        During the acclimation period no signs of disease were observed. All P. helianthoides challenged with 0.22 μm filtered live homogenate inoculum developed symptoms of (SSWD) including curling and lesions (Table 1). Lesions were noted at 8-9 days post injection in all three treatment animals. There was same individual variation in the onset and duration of clinical sign but signs were consistent between animals. Animals injected with the heat killed inoculum remained did not show clinical signs.

Transcriptome
Our sequencing effort result a combined 2.9x108 paired end reads among all six librarie. Sequencing reads are available in NCBI SRA Accession # XXXXXXXXX. After quality trimming reads were assembled into 29476 consensus sequences with an N50 value of 1757 bp (SUPPLEMENTAL FILE).  In order to assess the completeness of the  transcriptome, contigs were compared with the Patria with xx xx contigs matching … 


Comparisons of the Pycnopodia helianthoides transcriptome sequences to the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database resulted in annotation of 10513 contigs (SUPPLEMENTAL FILE)










Differentially Expressed Genes[aa][ab][ac]


Analysis with DESeq2 (Anders 2010) resulted in 3732 contigs that were differentially expressed between control and exposed  individuals.  Of those differentially expressed contigs, 1629 were expressed lower and 2103 were expressed higher in viral treated individuals. A total of 1183 differentially expressed contigs (31.7%) were annotated with SwissProt IDs.


Gene Ontology (GO) Enrichment[ad][ae][af]


Seventeen BP_FAT gene ontology (GO) terms were significantly enriched in the subset of annotated differentially expressed genes.  These terms fell into three broad categories: immune response, regulation of cytokine production, and biological adhesion(Figure 1)[ag][ah]. Immune response was the largest of these categories, with thirteen associated enriched GO terms. Table 1 lists all significantly enriched GO terms.  Regulation of cytokine biosynthetic process (GO:0042035) and activation of immune response (GO:0002253) were the two most enriched GO terms with fold enrichments of 5.881791 and 5.614436 respectively (Figure 2)[ai].  For all enriched GO terms, average log2 fold change of associated contigs was positive.[aj][ak][al][am][an] Adaptive immune response based on somatic recombination of immune receptors built from immunoglobulin superfamily domains (GO:0002460) had the highest average log2 fold change of all associated contigs (3.36) and G-protein coupled receptor protein signaling pathway (GO:0007186) had the lowest average log2 fold change (0.78) (Figure 3[ao])[ap][aq][ar][as][at][au].
Four proteins involved in the complement cascade were among those contributing to enriched processes.  There were: Ficolin-2 (Contig 7739, Contig 3867, Contig 107, Contig 1813, Contig 6139)[av], Complement C3 (Contig 3127, Contig 632), Properdin (Contig 312, ), and Complement C2 (Contig 1529).

Discussion


Toll Pathway
[IN introduction - brief introduction to innate immunity that includes mention and brief description of Toll, Complement…]


Sweeping changes in the Toll pathway of symptomatic seastars are apparent from the large number of genes belonging to enriched processes that map to this pathway. Activation of this element of the immune response begins with the recognition of pathogen motifs by __ , ___ and ___ …. 
- Early stages
* Rac1: filopodia formation for phagocytosis (Williams et al. 2007); mediator of ROS response following LPS (Cuadrado et al. 2014); “activating a complex program that includes cytoskeleton remodeling, chemotaxis, activation of NADPH oxidase, and modulation of gene expression” (Cuadrado et al. 2014); promotes inflammation in Manila clam hemocytes (Moreira et al. 2012)
* 



Complement Cascades


        Our differentially expressed contigs included four complement cascade proteins: Ficolin-2 (FCN2), Complement C3 (C3), Properdin (CFP), and Complement C2 (C2). For all of four protein annotations, at least one corresponding contig was more highly expressed in infected stars than in control samples.  However, contigs annotated as FCN2 had opposing log fold changes, suggesting either gene duplication and differential function or alternative splicing[az]. The complement cascade has been well documented in Echinoderms previously and contains C3, factor B/C2 (Smith et al. 1999). Here we document the presence of two additional complement cascade proteins which have not previously been described in Echinoderms, FCN2 and CFP. FCN2 is able to bind to both microbial pathogens to induce the complement cascade through association with mannan-binding lectin-associated serine proteases (Runza et al, 2008). CFP is an alternative mechanism for activation of the complement cascade which binds to apoptotic cells resulting in activation of the complement cascade and phagocytosis of bound cells (Kemper et al, 2008). Our results suggest that the complement cascade is an important part of sea star response to wasting disease, and furthermore, that Echinoderms may have a more complex complement cascade system than previously thought.


Melanization
One of the contigs with the largest log2 fold change was annotated as a quinone oxidoreductase(CRYZ).  Similar oxidoreductases (NQO1) in humans have been described as increasing melanin synthesis by increasing tyrosinase catalytic activity (Yamaguchi et al, 2010). Melanin synthesis cascades have been previously characterized in a number of Echinoderms(Canicatti and D’Ancona, 1998) and may play a role in lesion healing attempts by infected sea stars.


Adhesion: cell-cell (Morgan)
* * Wnt pathway disruption showing up regulation of some genes and downregulation of others
* Disruption leads to disease in other systems
* Regulates the adhesion junction between cells
* Also regulates (downstream) many of the connective tissues that make up the sea star dermas - connection here not as clear as the cell adhesion one.
* will manly use the papers on the Wnt pathway in echinoderms and the adhesome in echinoderms and build other literature off those. 
* Main point: there is evidence of Wnt/beta-catenin disruption which may be disrupting the cell adhesion and mutable collagenous tissues[ba].


Reyn’s conclusions(?) on neuro/MCT stuff[bb][bc][bd]
* We’re picking up lots of regeneration stuff and/or there’s a study bias (which of course there is).  I think Ruth will have lots to add to this aspect...
* Neuro - I really think it’s just messed up (how to phrase this eloquently…?) - I would use the word “disrupted” R: perfect
   * Neurexin-4 (down) - important for maintaining the glial-epithelial septate connections in Drosophila.  Could suggest decreased glial function.
   * GABA B Receptor 2 (down) - important neuroinhibitor that helps to fine-tune neural function.  
   * Norepinephrine transporter (down) - facilitates uptake of norepinephrine (stress hormone).  Lowered expression of the transporter could indicate an extended response.
   * Botch (up) - inhibits Notch pathway, over-expression encourages neural differentiation.  Neurogenesis?
   * BCL2L protein 1 (up) - In addition to its role in apoptosis (promotes or antagonizes depending on alternative splicing), BCL-2-like protein also promotes synaptic recovery through increased vesicle endocytosis.
   * Neurensin-1 (up) - important for neurite extension.  Consistent with Botch in terms of neurogenesis.
   * Netrin Receptors UNC5D (up more) and UNC5B (down) - Netrin is important in axon guidance and its expression might suggest neurogenesis or maybe remodelling. 
* Coelomocyte response - clotting seems depressed and coelomocytes may be proliferating
   * ADAMTS13 (up) - cleaves vWF, which is a clotting factor, making it less effective
   * Myocilin (down) - important factor in coelomocyte adhesion (clotting).  Also plays a role in cell proliferation/survival, where decreased expression is related to decreases in both (which is a bit contradictory considering my next point…)
   * Protein Skeletor (up) - a component of the spindle matrix that supports the mitotic spindle.  Increased expression may suggest greater division and proliferation of coelomocytes.  (they may not be completely contradictory depending on how you think of the balance between proliferation and apoptosis - maybe just swift turnover?)
* MCT in specific - suggests modulation or degradation of MCT
   * Collagenase 3 (up) - this is one of our highest DEGs, so we should talk about it regardless.  Matrix metalloproteinases in general are very important in modulating the MCT.  They also degrade the components of the MCT and so may explain the decreased turgor/rigidity of the diseased stars.
   * Collagen alpha-1(XIV) chain (up) - component of MCT


Insights into Sea Star Wasting Disease Pathology
Observable signs of SSWD include a deflated appearance, twisting arms, lesions, and in advanced cases arm autotomy and death.  These suggest a role of nervous system and connective tissues in the disease pathology.  The nervous system is the primary control of adhesion and connective tissues, including the mutable collagenous tissues (MCT), which are key in maintaining sea star structure.  Our transcriptome yielded several differentially expressed genes that suggest a disruption of neural function, possibly having downstream effects to connective tissue function.  Norepinephrine transporter, responsible for the uptake of norepinephrine into synaptic terminals, was under-expressed in diseased stars, suggesting an increase in stress response.  BCL-2-like protein 1 (BCLx) was also under-expressed.  While it has a role in apoptosis, BCLx also regulates synaptic activity.  This is also evidence for neurogenesis:   


Conclusions
When infected with sea star wasting disease, Pycnopodia helianthoides activates _____ pathways. Our analysis of differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways in the sea star transcriptome shows that, similar to urchins, sea stars have a complex immune response involving thousands of genes. While further studies are needed to differentiate the gene expression changes following infection with wasting disease from other pathogens, our P. helianthoides lays the foundations for better characterization of sea star immune response. Comparison with the few other echinoderm transcriptomes, Stronglylocentrotus purpuratus and Pateria miniata, can provide insight into the evolution of immunity-related genes in deuterostomes.

[a]these points are great- would just flip - start big
[b]Agreed. Let's start with the big picture and then narrow in, as we're doing in the results and discussion
[c]maybe sell taxonomic relation with vertebrates in lead paragraph
[d]a transition
[e]We're still working on it
[f]needs ref
[g]Monica, can we cite the MARINe team on this? Or Pisco.
[h]If we can cite the PISCO website on it: seastarwasting.org, then we're good. Alternatively, I have a ScienceNews article, although that's not the same as a reviewed article.
[i]There's also a PISCO press release from 12/2013. It's not as current, but it's a little more permanent.
[j]http://www.eeb.ucsc.edu/pacificrockyintertidal/data-products/sea-star-wasting/PressRelease_Final_22DEC2013.pdf
[k]provide some basics about invertebrate immunity (ie lack of adaptive etc
[l]I will add some of this.
[m]I can easily revise this to include all 20 animals we injected but have chosen to just talk about the 6 we used in this draft. I think for draft 1 it should stay like this and maybe revise later. Thoughts?
[n]I think that's valid esp. since they're the only ones that these data came from
[o]ok good. that makes sense to me too.
[p]I agree to keep to the animals used in the analyses and can decide if add more later
[q]use or anacronym? or write out ?
[r]Collin / Ruth were you following up on this?
[s]On it.
[t]What?
[u]this is just text DAVID used to describe GO FAT (a previous reviewer had wanted it) we can remove
[v]can you go ahead and get placeholder figures in the draft??
[w]Is this table helpful? More info? Less? Nothing?
[x]I think that HK and LV are unusual and a bit confusing.  I might stick with Control and Exposed?
[y]Sure, will change.
[z]I don't see the need for another figure on the experiment since the focus is on the expression. Please let me know if you have ideas on a better way to represent data.
[aa]Need a tab-delim file with contig / IDs evalues etc for Supp Info - maybe one file with row for each contig?
[ab]Agreed, yes.
[ac]Yes.
[ad]What other info do we want here?
[ae]For each pathway - I suggest listing some of the specific proteins (with contig IDs)
[af]heatmap?
[ag]Revigo map?
[ah]sure lets start with that
[ai]Graph of fold enrichment for each term?  Or we can just include in above table
[aj]what does this mean? why is it significant?
[ak]_Marked as resolved_
[al]_Re-opened_
[am]None were on average lower expressed in sea stars... But I think this comment could be addressed with the graph maybe?
[an]There were no significant GO terms associated with contigs which were lower expressed in viral exposed stars
[ao]place holder to help guide flow
[ap]Graph of average log2foldchange for each GO term?
[aq]Should we make a folder for graphs and everyone can put what they have into it and then we can decide on the best way to visualize these things?
[ar]I can upload graphs to the drive that I have so far.  They'll definitely need to be improved/prettified
[as]yeah we can redo things. but maybe jsut looking at various graphs will let us see which are most informative together
[at]alright i'll get some put up!
[au]It's in the SS folder in morgan's drive
[av]this opens up question as to why so many contigs?
[aw]We can change the colors if we want. Let me know what to add to the caption.
[ax]will need more information- size means something....
[ay]If everyone sends me a list of the contigs in their pathway I can make a heatmap that has a breakdown of each pathway so toll, complement, etc etc.
[az]Need to investigate this further to make a solid comment.
[ba]Ruth and Reyn, I know you guys have more. I have focused on the Wnt pathway as a source for a disruption but you have more on what could be the result.
[bb]Nice! I will add more detail to mine so we can see where there is connection. I think it is 3 sections (paragraphs). Neuro -> adhesion -> MCT?
[bc]I like that idea
[bd]Check out this paper: Whittaker et al 2006. It is in my folder.
